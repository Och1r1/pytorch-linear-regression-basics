ðŸ“˜ PyTorch Workflow Fundamentals: Linear Regression from Scratch
This project demonstrates a complete PyTorch machine learning workflow, using a simple linear regression model built from scratch. It covers everything from data preparation to model building, training, and evaluation â€” ideal for those learning the basics of PyTorch and neural networks.

<br>
ðŸ“Œ Overview
In this notebook, I:
- Generated synthetic linear data
- Built a custom linear regression model using nn.Module
- Created a training and evaluation pipeline
- Visualized predictions and model performance
- This project helped solidify my understanding of:
- Tensors and basic PyTorch operations
- Model parameters and forward passes
- Manual optimization logic and loss tracking
